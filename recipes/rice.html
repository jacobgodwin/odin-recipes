    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fluffy rice that is elevated with spices and coconut oil.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup Jasmine Rice</li>
      <li>1 TBSP Grated Ginger</li>
      <li>1 TSP Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 TSP Tumeric</li>
      <li>1 TBSP Coconut Oil</li>
      <li>1/4 TSP Ground Ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I like to use a 2:1, water to rice, ratio for this recipe. Usually 1/2
        cup of rice is about 90g so I use 180g of water and bring that to a
        boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        As the water is coming to a boil, add all of the rest of the spices and
        ingredients and stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the water is boiling, add your rice, reduce the heat to low, and
        cook covered for 15 minutes. It's important not to lift the lid and
        release any steam as this will interrupt the cooking process.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 15 minutes, remove the pot from the heat but do not remove the lid
        and let it sit for 15 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the final 15 minutes are up, fluff the rice with a fork and serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
