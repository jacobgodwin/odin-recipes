    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 Heads of Broccoli</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>

      <li>Wash and chop up your broccoli into florets.</li>
      <li>
        Toss the broccoli in about 3 - 4 TBSP of olive oil, season with a
        generous pinch of salt and few cranks of black pepper, and spread it out
        on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. (The aluminum foil makes for a
        quick cleanup)

      <li>
        Roast the broccoli for about 15 minutes, then give it a toss and roast
        for about 15 more minutes or until the broccoli is crispy and has a
        slight char to some of the florets.

        lemon and serve.
