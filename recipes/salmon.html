    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Perfect, flaky salmon that is seared with a mayo marinade, and then
      finished in the oven.
      <br />
      <br />
      The mayo-marinade provides a binder for spices to stick to the salmon and
      is used to get nice brown crust without the need for extra oil in the pan.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Salmon Fillets</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>Kosher Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Lemon</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pre-heat the oven to 400F</li>
      <li>
        Brine the salmon by combining <strong>40g</strong> of kosher salt and
        <strong>10g</strong> of sugar in a bowl. Pour the mixture over the
        salmon and coat the flesh of the fish. Let it sit in the fridge for
        about 30 minutes. This will help firm up the skin for cooking and
        provide some seasoning to the fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the salmon is dry brining, measure out
        <strong>1.5 TBSP</strong> of mayo in a bowl along with the
        <strong>zest of 1</strong> lemon, <strong>.5 TBSP</strong> of oregano,
        and a few cranks of cracked, black pepper. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the 30 minute dry brine is done, rinse the salmon with cold water
        and pat dry with a paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the salmon with kosher salt and pepper. Then smear the
        mayo-marinade over the flesh of the salmon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a cast-iron skillet or oven-safe skillet over medium to medium-high
        heat. We want this pretty hot to get a nice sear on the flesh as we'll
        be finishing it off in the oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pan is hot, place the salmon, skin-side down, in the pan and
        sear for about 2 - 4 minutes checking to make sure the flesh doesn't
        burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once a nice golden brown sear is achieved, flip the salmon over and
        crisp up the skin for a minute and then toss the pan in the oven for 6 -
        10 minutes depending on the thickness of the salmon and your preferred
        doneness. (I like to aim for 125F - 135F internal temperature for a
        moist and flaky salmon)

    </ol>
